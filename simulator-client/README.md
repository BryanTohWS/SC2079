# Algo Simulator

This simulator uses Next.js. It communicates with the Flask service (in the service folder) to simulate pathfinding.

## Setup:

Ensure you are in the simulator-client directory:
```shell
cd simulator-client
```

Install dependencies:
```shell
npm i
```

Run the script:
```shell
npm run dev
```

The simulator should be running on http://localhost:3000
